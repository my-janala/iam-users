# iam-users

## Objective

Creating various IAM users

- Users: nevsa, cordelia, kriste, darleen, wynnie, vonnie, emelita, maurita, devinne,  .

- Environments: dev, qa, uat, test, prod

Write simple HCL code to:

- Create users in AWS for each environment: *($USERNAME-$ENV)

- All resources must be created with single `terraform apply`

- Please make your solution available in a public source-code repository.

- Extra point if you nicely format the output with username, access_key, secret access key in one line.
